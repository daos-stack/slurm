  https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Packaging_scriptlet_snippets)
  (bsc#1100850).
* Tue Jun  5 2018 cgoll@suse.com
- Update from 17.11.5 to 17.11.7
- Fix security issue in handling of username and gid fields
  CVE-2018-10995 and bsc#1095508 what implied an
  update from 17.11.5 to 17.11.7
  Highlights of 17.11.6:
  * CRAY - Add slurmsmwd to the contribs/cray dir
  * PMIX - Added the direct connect authentication.
  * Prevent the backup slurmctld from losing the active/available node
    features list on takeover.
  * Be able to force power_down of cloud node even if in power_save state.
  * Allow cloud nodes to be recognized in Slurm when booted out of band.
  * Numerous fixes - check 'NEWS' file.
  Highlights of 17.11.7:
  * Notify srun and ctld when unkillable stepd exits.
  * Numerous fixes - check 'NEWS' file.
- Add: slurmsmwd-uses-xdaemon_-for-systemd.patch
  * Fixes daemoniziation in newly introduced slurmsmwd daemon.
- Rename:
  split-xdaemon-in-xdaemon_init-and-xdaemon_finish-for-systemd-compatibilty.patch
  to split-xdaemon-in-xdaemon_init-and-xdaemon_finish-for.patch
  * remain in sync with commit messages which introduced that file
* Thu Apr 19 2018 eich@suse.com
- Avoid running pretrans scripts when running in an instsys:
  there may be not much installed, yet. pretrans code should
  be done in lua, this way, it will be executed by the rpm-internal
  lua interpreter and not be passed to a shell which may not be
  around at the time this scriptlet is run (bsc#1090292).
* Fri Apr 13 2018 eich@suse.com

  * split-xdaemon-in-xdaemon_init-and-xdaemon_finish-for-systemd-compatibilty.patch
  * slurmctld-uses-xdaemon_-for-systemd.patch
  * slurmd-uses-xdaemon_-for-systemd.patch
  * slurmdbd-uses-xdaemon_-for-systemd.patch
  * removed-deprecated-xdaemon.patch
  Fix interaction with systemd: systemd expects that a
  daemonizing process doesn't go away until the PID file
  with it PID of the daemon has bee written (bsc#1084125).
* Wed Apr 11 2018 eich@suse.com
- Make sure systemd services get restarted only when all
  packages are in a consistent state, not in the middle
  of an 'update' transaction (bsc#1088693).
  Since the %%postun scripts that run on update are from
  the old package they cannot be changed - thus we work
  around the restart breakage.
* Fri Mar 23 2018 cgoll@suse.com
- fixed wrong log file location in slurmdbd.conf and
  fixed pid location for slurmdbd and made slurm-slurmdbd

  strings within the slurmdbd. CVE-2018-7033
  http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-7033
  (bsc#1085240).
- Update slurm to v17.11.5 (FATE#325451)
  Highlights of 17.11:
  * Support for federated clusters to manage a single work-flow
    across a set of clusters.
  * Support for heterogeneous job allocations (various processor types,
    memory sizes, etc. by job component). Support for heterogeneous job
    steps within a single MPI_COMM_WORLD is not yet supported for most
    configurations.
  * X11 support is now fully integrated with the main Slurm code. Remove
    any X11 plugin configured in your plugstack.conf file to avoid errors
    being logged about conflicting options.
  * Added new advanced reservation flag of "flex", which permits jobs
    requesting the reservation to begin prior to the reservation's
    start time and use resources inside or outside of the reservation.
    A typical use case is to prevent jobs not explicitly requesting the
    reservation from using those reserved resources rather than forcing
    jobs requesting the reservation to use those resources in the time
    frame reserved.
  * The sprio command has been modified to report a job's priority
    information for every partition the job has been submitted to.
  * Group ID lookup performed at job submit time to avoid lookup on
    all compute nodes. Enable with PrologFlags=SendGIDs configuration
    parameter.
  * Slurm commands and daemons dynamically link to libslurmfull.so
    instead of statically linking. This dramatically reduces the
    footprint of Slurm.
  * In switch plugin, added plugin_id symbol to plugins and wrapped
    switch_jobinfo_t with dynamic_plugin_data_t in interface calls
    in order to pass switch information between clusters with different
    switch types.
  * Changed default ProctrackType to cgroup.
  * Changed default sched_min_interval from 0 to 2 microseconds.
  * Added new 'scontrol write batch_script ' command to fetch a job's
    batch script. Removed the ability to see the script as part of the
    'scontrol -dd   show job' command.
  * Add new "billing" TRES which allows jobs to be limited based on the
    job's billable TRES calculated by the job's partition's
    TRESBillingWeights.
  * Regular user use of "scontrol top" command is now disabled. Use the
    configuration parameter "SchedulerParameters=enable_user_top" to
    enable that functionality. The configuration parameter
    "SchedulerParameters=disable_user_top" will be silently ignored.
  * Change default to let pending jobs run outside of reservation after
    reservation is gone to put jobs in held state. Added
    NO_HOLD_JOBS_AFTER_END reservation flag to use old default.
    Support for PMIx v2.0 as well as UCX support.
  * Remove plugins for obsolete MPI stacks:
  - lam
  - mpich1_p4
  - mpich1_shmem
  - mvapich
  * Numerous fixes - check 'NEWS' file.
- slurmd-Fix-slurmd-for-new-API-in-hwloc-2.0.patch
  plugins-cgroup-Fix-slurmd-for-new-API-in-hwloc-2.0.patch:
  Removed. Code upstream.
- slurmctld-service-var-run-path.patch:
  Replaced by sed script.
- Fix some rpmlint warnings.
* Mon Jan 29 2018 cgoll@suse.com
- moved config files to slurm-config package (FATE#324574).
* Mon Jan 29 2018 jjolly@suse.com
- Moved slurmstepd and man page into slurm-node due to slurmd dependency
- Moved config files into slurm-node
- Moved slurmd rc scripts into slurm-node
- Made slurm-munge require slurm-plugins instead of slurm itself
  - slurm-node suggested slurm-munge, causing the whole slurm to be
    installed. The slurm-plugins seems to be a more base class
    (FATE#324574).
* Wed Jan 17 2018 cgoll@suse.com
- split up light wight slurm-node package for deployment on nodes
  (FATE#324574).
* Fri Dec  1 2017 cgoll@suse.com
- added /var/spool/ directory and removed duplicated entries from slurm.conf
* Fri Nov 10 2017 eich@suse.com
- Package so-versioned libs separately. libslurm is expected
  to change more frequently and thus is packaged separately
  from libpmi.
* Wed Nov  1 2017 eich@suse.com
- Updated to 17.02.9 to fix CVE-2017-15566 (bsc#1065697).

  * Remove StoragePass from being printed out in the slurmdbd log at debug2
  level.
  * Defer PATH search for task program until launch in slurmstepd.
  * Modify regression test1.89 to avoid leaving vestigial job. Also reduce
    logging to reduce likelyhood of Expect buffer overflow.
  * Do not PATH search for mult-prog launches if LaunchParamters=test_exec is
    enabled.
  * Fix for possible infinite loop in select/cons_res plugin when trying to
    satisfy a job's ntasks_per_core or socket specification.
  * If job is held for bad constraints make it so once updated the job doesn't
    go into JobAdminHeld.
  * sched/backfill - Fix logic to reserve resources for jobs that require a
    node reboot (i.e. to change KNL mode) in order to start.
  * When unpacking a node or front_end record from state and the protocol
    version is lower than the min version, set it to the min.
  * Remove redundant lookup for part_ptr when updating a reservation's nodes.
  * Fix memory and file descriptor leaks in slurmd daemon's sbcast logic.
  * Do not allocate specialized cores to jobs using the --exclusive option.

  "PrologFlags=alloc" configured. Send new error prolog failure message to
  the salloc or srun command as needed.
  * Prevent possible out-of-bounds read in slurmstepd on an invalid #! line.
  * Fix check for PluginDir within slurmctld to work with multiple directories.
  * Cancel interactive jobs automatically on communication error to launching
  srun/salloc process.
  * Fix security issue caused by insecure file path handling triggered by the
  failure of a Prolog script. To exploit this a user needs to anticipate or
  cause the Prolog to fail for their job. CVE-2016-10030 (bsc#1018371).
- Replace group/user add macros with function calls.
- Fix array initialzation and ensure strings are always NULL terminated in
-  pam_slurm.c (bsc#1007053).
- Disable building with netloc support: the netloc API is part of the devel
  branch of hwloc. Since this devel branch was included accidentally and has
  been reversed since, we need to disable this for the time being.
- Conditionalized architecture specific pieces to support non-x86 architectures
  better.
* Tue Jan  3 2017 eich@suse.com
- Remove: unneeded 'BuildRequires:  python'
- Add:
  BuildRequires:  freeipmi-devel
  BuildRequires:  libibmad-devel
  BuildRequires:  libibumad-devel
  so they are picked up by the slurm build.
- Enable modifications from openHPC Project.
- Enable lua API package build.
- Add a recommends for slurm-munge to the slurm package:
  This is way, the munge auth method is available and slurm
  works out of the box.
- Create /var/lib/slurm as StateSaveLocation directory.
  /tmp is dangerous.
* Fri Dec  2 2016 eich@suse.com
- Create slurm user/group in preinstall script.
* Wed Nov 30 2016 eich@suse.com
- Keep %%{_libdir}/libpmi* and %%{_libdir}/mpi_pmi2* on SUSE.
* Tue Nov 22 2016 eich@suse.com
- Fix build with and without OHCP_BUILD define.
- Fix build for systemd and non-systemd.
* Fri Nov  4 2016 eich@suse.com
- Updated to 16-05-5 - equvalent to OpenHPC 1.2.
  * Fix issue with resizing jobs and limits not be kept track of correctly.
  * BGQ - Remove redeclaration of job_read_lock.
  * BGQ - Tighter locks around structures when nodes/cables change state.
  * Make it possible to change CPUsPerTask with scontrol.
  * Make it so scontrol update part qos= will take away a partition QOS from
    a partition.
  * Backfill scheduling properly synchronized with Cray Node Health Check.
    Prior logic could result in highest priority job getting improperly
    postponed.
  * Make it so daemons also support TopologyParam=NoInAddrAny.
  * If scancel is operating on large number of jobs and RPC responses from
    slurmctld daemon are slow then introduce a delay in sending the cancel job
    requests from scancel in order to reduce load on slurmctld.
  * Remove redundant logic when updating a job's task count.
  * MySQL - Fix querying jobs with reservations when the id's have rolled.
  * Perl - Fix use of uninitialized variable in slurm_job_step_get_pids.
  * Launch batch job requsting --reboot after the boot completes.
  * Do not attempt to power down a node which has never responded if the
    slurmctld daemon restarts without state.
  * Fix for possible slurmstepd segfault on invalid user ID.
  * MySQL - Fix for possible race condition when archiving multiple clusters
    at the same time.
  * Add logic so that slurmstepd can be launched under valgrind.
  * Increase buffer size to read /proc/*/stat files.
  * Remove the SchedulerParameters option of "assoc_limit_continue", making it
    the default value. Add option of "assoc_limit_stop". If "assoc_limit_stop"
    is set and a job cannot start due to association limits, then do not attempt
    to initiate any lower priority jobs in that partition. Setting this can
    decrease system throughput and utlization, but avoid potentially starving
    larger jobs by preventing them from launching indefinitely.
  * Update a node's socket and cores per socket counts as needed after a node
    boot to reflect configuration changes which can occur on KNL processors.
    Note that the node's total core count must not change, only the distribution
    of cores across varying socket counts (KNL NUMA nodes treated as sockets by
    Slurm).
  * Rename partition configuration from "Shared" to "OverSubscribe". Rename
    salloc, sbatch, srun option from "--shared" to "--oversubscribe". The old
    options will continue to function. Output field names also changed in
    scontrol, sinfo, squeue and sview.
  * Add SLURM_UMASK environment variable to user job.
  * knl_conf: Added new configuration parameter of CapmcPollFreq.
  * Cleanup two minor Coverity warnings.

    they are in a step.
  * Correct partition's MaxCPUsPerNode enforcement when nodes are shared by
    multiple partitions.
  * node_feature/knl_cray - Prevent slurmctld GRES errors for "hbm" references.
  * Display thread name instead of thread id and remove process name in stderr
    logging for "thread_id" LogTimeFormat.

  * Move test for job wait reason value of BurstBufferResources and
    BurstBufferStageIn later in the scheduling logic.
  * Document which srun options apply to only job, only step, or job and step
    allocations.
  * Use more compatible function to get thread name (>= 2.6.11).
  * Make it so the extern step uses a reverse tree when cleaning up.
  * If extern step doesn't get added into the proctrack plugin make sure the
    sleep is killed.
  * Add web links to Slurm Diamond Collectors (from Harvard University) and
    collectd (from EDF).
  * Add job_submit plugin for the "reboot" field.
  * Make some more Slurm constants (INFINITE, NO_VAL64, etc.) available to
    job_submit/lua plugins.
  * Send in a -1 for a taskid into spank_task_post_fork for the extern_step.
  * MYSQL - Sightly better logic if a job completion comes in with an end time
    of 0.
  * task/cgroup plugin is configured with ConstrainRAMSpace=yes, then set soft

- version 15.08.7.1
  * Remove the 1024-character limit on lines in batch scripts.
    task/affinity: Disable core-level task binding if more CPUs required than
    available cores.
  * Preemption/gang scheduling: If a job is suspended at slurmctld restart or
    reconfiguration time, then leave it suspended rather than resume+suspend.
  * Don't use lower weight nodes for job allocation when topology/tree used.
  * Don't allow user specified reservation names to disrupt the normal
    reservation sequeuece numbering scheme.
  * Avoid hard-link/copy of script/environment files for job arrays. Use the
    master job record file for all tasks of the job array.
    NOTE: Job arrays submitted to Slurm version 15.08.6 or later will fail if
    the slurmctld daemon is downgraded to an earlier version of Slurm.
  * In slurmctld log file, log duplicate job ID found by slurmd. Previously was
    being logged as prolog/epilog failure.
  * If a job is requeued while in the process of being launch, remove it's
    job ID from slurmd's record of active jobs in order to avoid generating a
    duplicate job ID error when launched for the second time (which would
    drain the node).
  * Cleanup messages when handling job script and environment variables in
    older directory structure formats.
  * Prevent triggering gang scheduling within a partition if configured with
    PreemptType=partition_prio and PreemptMode=suspend,gang.
  * Decrease parallelism in job cancel request to prevent denial of service
    when cancelling huge numbers of jobs.
  * If all ephemeral ports are in use, try using other port numbers.
  * Prevent "scontrol update job" from updating jobs that have already finished.
  * Show requested TRES in "squeue -O tres" when job is pending.
  * Backfill scheduler: Test association and QOS node limits before reserving
    resources for pending job.
  * Many bug fixes.
- Use source services to download package.
- Fix code for new API of hwloc-2.0.
- package netloc_to_topology where avialable.
- Package documentation.
* Sun Nov  1 2015 scorot@free.fr
- version 15.08.3
  * Many new features and bug fixes. See NEWS file
- update files list accordingly
- fix wrong end of line in some files
* Thu Aug  6 2015 scorot@free.fr
- version 14.11.8
  * Many bug fixes. See NEWS file
- update files list accordingly
* Sun Nov  2 2014 scorot@free.fr
- add missing systemd requirements
- add missing rclink
* Sun Nov  2 2014 scorot@free.fr
- version 14.03.9
  * Many bug fixes. See NEWS file
- add systemd support
* Sat Jul 26 2014 scorot@free.fr
- version 14.03.6
  * Added support for native Slurm operation on Cray systems
    (without ALPS).
  * Added partition configuration parameters AllowAccounts,
    AllowQOS, DenyAccounts and DenyQOS to provide greater control
    over use.
  * Added the ability to perform load based scheduling. Allocating
    resources to jobs on the nodes with the largest number if idle
    CPUs.
  * Added support for reserving cores on a compute node for system
    services (core specialization)
  * Add mechanism for job_submit plugin to generate error message
    for srun, salloc or sbatch to stderr.
  * Support for Postgres database has long since been out of date
    and problematic, so it has been removed entirely.  If you
    would like to use it the code still exists in <= 2.6, but will
    not be included in this and future versions of the code.
  * Added new structures and support for both server and cluster
    resources.
  * Significant performance improvements, especially with respect
    to job array support.
- update files list
* Sun Mar 16 2014 scorot@free.fr
- update to version 2.6.7
  * Support for job arrays, which increases performance and ease of
    use for sets of similar jobs.
  * Job profiling capability added to record a wide variety of job
    characteristics for each task on a user configurable periodic
    basis. Data currently available includes CPU use, memory use,
    energy use, Infiniband network use, Lustre file system use, etc.
  * Support for MPICH2 using PMI2 communications interface with much
    greater scalability.
  * Prolog and epilog support for advanced reservations.
  * Much faster throughput for job step execution with --exclusive
    option. The srun process is notified when resources become
    available rather than periodic polling.
  * Support improved for Intel MIC (Many Integrated Core) processor.
  * Advanced reservations with hostname and core counts now supports
    asymmetric reservations (e.g. specific different core count for
    each node).
  * External sensor plugin infrastructure added to record power
    consumption, temperature, etc.
  * Improved performance for high-throughput computing.
  * MapReduce+ support (launches ~1000x faster, runs ~10x faster).
  * Added "MaxCPUsPerNode" partition configuration parameter. This
    can be especially useful to schedule GPUs. For example a node
    can be associated with two Slurm partitions (e.g. "cpu" and
    "gpu") and the partition/queue "cpu" could be limited to only a
    subset of the node's CPUs, insuring that one or more CPUs would
    be available to jobs in the "gpu" partition/queue.
* Thu Jun  6 2013 scorot@free.fr
- version 2.5.7
  * Fix for linking to the select/cray plugin to not give warning
    about undefined variable.
  * Add missing symbols to the xlator.h
  * Avoid placing pending jobs in AdminHold state due to backfill
    scheduler interactions with advanced reservation.
  * Accounting - make average by task not cpu.
  * POE - Correct logic to support poe option "-euidevice sn_all"
    and "-euidevice sn_single".
  * Accounting - Fix minor initialization error.
  * POE - Correct logic to support srun network instances count
    with POE.
  * POE - With the srun --launch-cmd option, report proper task
    count when the --cpus-per-task option is used without the
  - -ntasks option.
  * POE - Fix logic binding tasks to CPUs.
  * sview - Fix race condition where new information could of
    slipped past the node tab and we didn't notice.
  * Accounting - Fix an invalid memory read when slurmctld sends
    data about start job to slurmdbd.
  * If a prolog or epilog failure occurs, drain the node rather
    than setting it down and killing all of its jobs.
  * Priority/multifactor - Avoid underflow in half-life calculation.
  * POE - pack missing variable to allow fanout (more than 32
    nodes)
  * Prevent clearing reason field for pending jobs. This bug was
    introduced in v2.5.5 (see "Reject job at submit time ...").
  * BGQ - Fix issue with preemption on sub-block jobs where a job
    would kill all preemptable jobs on the midplane instead of just
    the ones it needed to.
  * switch/nrt - Validate dynamic window allocation size.
  * BGQ - When --geo is requested do not impose the default
    conn_types.
  * RebootNode logic - Defers (rather than forgets) reboot request
    with job running on the node within a reservation.
  * switch/nrt - Correct network_id use logic. Correct support for
    user sn_all and sn_single options.
  * sched/backfill - Modify logic to reduce overhead under heavy
    load.
  * Fix job step allocation with --exclusive and --hostlist option.
  * Select/cons_res - Fix bug resulting in error of "cons_res: sync
    loop not progressing, holding job #"
  * checkpoint/blcr - Reset max_nodes from zero to NO_VAL on job
    restart.
  * launch/poe - Fix for hostlist file support with repeated host
    names.
  * priority/multifactor2 - Prevent possible divide by zero.
  - - srun - Don't check for executable if --test-only flag is
    used.
  * energy - On a single node only use the last task for gathering
    energy. Since we don't currently track energy usage per task
    (only per step). Otherwise we get double the energy.
* Sat Apr  6 2013 scorot@free.fr
- version 2.5.4
  * Support for Intel® Many Integrated Core (MIC) processors.
  * User control over CPU frequency of each job step.
  * Recording power usage information for each job.
  * Advanced reservation of cores rather than whole nodes.
  * Integration with IBM's Parallel Environment including POE (Parallel
    Operating Environment) and NRT (Network Resource Table) API.
  * Highly optimized throughput for serial jobs in a new
    "select/serial" plugin.
  * CPU load is information available
  * Configurable number of CPUs available to jobs in each SLURM
    partition, which provides a mechanism to reserve CPUs for use
    with GPUs.
