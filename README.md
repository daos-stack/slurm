This is the Slurm Workload Manager. Slurm is an open-source cluster resource management and job
scheduling system that strives to be simple, scalable, portable, fault-tolerant, and interconnect
agnostic. Slurm currently has been tested only under Linux.

As a cluster resource manager, Slurm provides three key functions. First, it allocates exclusive
and/or non-exclusive access to resources (compute nodes) to users for some duration of time so they
can perform work. Second, it provides a framework for starting, executing, and monitoring work
(normally a parallel job) on the set of allocated nodes. Finally, it arbitrates conflicting requests
for resources by managing a queue of pending work.
